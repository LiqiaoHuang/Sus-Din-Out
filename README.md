# Sus-Din-Out
This GitHub repository contains Jupyter Notebooks detailing our methods for analyzing sustainable dining practices in Tokyo.

The notebooks include SDOI_calculation.ipynb for calculating the Sustainable Dining Out Index, Price_considered.ipynb for exploring economic pathways to sustainable dining, and Results_analysis.ipynb for visualizing disparities in restaurant distribution and sustainability across urban areas. 

These resources support our study on the interplay between urbanization, culinary identity, and sustainability in dining choices.
